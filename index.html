      Pangolins, sometimes known as scaly anteaters,[6] are mammals of the order
      Pholidota (/fɒlɪˈdoʊtə/, from Ancient Greek ϕολιδωτός 'clad in
      scales').[7] The one extant family, Manidae, has three genera: Manis,
      Phataginus and Smutsia. Manis comprises the four species found in Asia,
      while Phataginus and Smutsia include two species each, all found in
      sub-Saharan Africa.[8] These species range in size from 30 to 100 cm (12
      to 39 in). A number of extinct pangolin species are also known. Pangolins
      have large, protective keratin scales covering their skin; they are the
      only known mammals with this feature. They live in hollow trees or
      burrows, depending on the species. Pangolins are nocturnal, and their diet
      consists of mainly ants and termites, which they capture using their long
      tongues. They tend to be solitary animals, meeting only to mate and
      produce a litter of one to three offspring, which they raise for about two
      years. Pangolins are threatened by poaching (for their meat and scales,
      which are used in Chinese traditional medicine[9]) and heavy deforestation
      of their natural habitats, and are the most trafficked mammals in the
      world.[10] As of January 2020, there are eight species of pangolin whose
      conservation status is listed in the threatened tier. Three (Manis
      culionensis, M. pentadactyla and M. javanica) are critically endangered,
      three (Phataginus tricuspis, Manis crassicaudata and Smutsia gigantea) are
      endangered and two (Phataginus tetradactyla and Smutsia temminckii) are
      vulnerable on the Red List of Threatened Species of the International
      Union for Conservation of Nature.[11]
